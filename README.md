Document Objectives
The purpose of this document is to provide detailed documentation about the Music Tournament application I will be building for my Prime Solo Project. It will include such details as:
 
All Features described, how the app works
Technology stack used (Frameworks, Libraries), including any 3rd party APIs/web services
Milestones and rough schedule
Assumptions made during the scoping process
Application Overview
Music Tournament is a full-stack web application that allows you to create dynamic music tournaments that populate music tracks in an easy to listen to and score fashion. It provides an interface to curate songs to compete in the tournament. It allows you to listen to pairs of songs in a matchup and provide votes while matchups are “live”, and then tabulates results and advances winners.

Project Features and Schedule
Features are completed, working features from the above listing. Think carefully about the order you will need to build things and when you expect to be done with them. The purpose of this section is to consider the overall timeline and how much work really needs to get done. The Due Date is your best guess and may change. (There should be many more than 3 features.)

Assumptions
I am able to digest and understand the Spotify API options and associated technologies in order to build functionality live on app. Resources currently consulting include:
https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-node
https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/tutorial/
I will be able to commit a significant amount of time over break to do this
The Spotify API functionality will not significantly change in the next 4 weeks
Embedded playlists using the API will be free for anyone to listen to in a similar way that hardcoding the embed code for a playlist currently works

Technologies
Angular
Node
Express
Spotify Web API
browserify/webpack/rollup (as noted in API webpack I am researching)
SQL
Angular Routes/Angular Material
Stretch Goals
In addition to just allowing users to participate in tournaments and vote, I want to build out a list of the songs they voted highest for to be stored on their profile.
Additional statistics around how certain songs or artists do across many tournaments (like in the far future, being able to see an Artist or Song profile to see how it scored and where it exited, something like that.)
Ensure that the two song playlists that are being generated for a given match are deleted once the match is completed, otherwise whoever created the tournament is going to end up with a whole bunch of two song playlists on their personal Spotify account
Store a Sweet 16 playlist attached to archived tournaments
Pull Artist images/artwork to decorate the bracket.
Cool CSS effects
